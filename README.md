# SMTX: A Robust SMT-LIB Static Validator

The Satisfiability Modulo Theories Type-checker (SMTX) is a specialized type checker built on Golangâ€™s type system that performs precise and efficient validation of SMT-LIB2 logical formulas.

SMTX is part of a larger project, SMTX, that focuses on improving SMT solving using static analysis and _pre-solver_ tools.

## Implementation

SMTX is implemented in Go, leveraging its strong type system and efficient compilation. The implementation focuses on:

- Type-safe validation of SMT-LIB2 (v2.6) expressions
- Efficient memory management using Go's garbage collection
- Modular design with separate theory implementations
- Performance optimization through concurrent validation

The core architecture consists of:

- A lexer/parser for SMT-LIB2 syntax
- Type inference and checking system
- Theory-specific validators
- Logic combinators
- Detailed error reporting and diagnostic suggestions

### @TODO [SMT-LIB as a Type Definition Language: A Self-Extensible Type Checking Framework](#)

**Abstract:**

This paper presents a novel approach to SMT-LIB type checking by leveraging SMT-LIB itself as a definition language. Our framework implements a standalone type checker that operates independently of any SMT solver, enabling early error detection and improved development workflow. Built on the formal grammar specification of SMT-LIB v2.7, it validates SMT formulas and interprets SMT-LIB specifications as type definition files, facilitating dynamic type system extension while maintaining strict standard compliance.

The type checker's architecture emphasizes performance through optimized parsing and validation algorithms, providing concise yet precise error reporting. By avoiding verbose output in favor of targeted diagnostic messages, it maintains exceptional processing speed even with complex SMT formulas. Our self-contained system, which uses SMT-LIB as both input language and type definition format, supports seamless extensibility while preserving implementation integrity. [[read more...]](#)
