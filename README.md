# SMTC: A Robust SMT-LIB Static Validator

The Satisfiability Modulo Theories Type-checker (SMTC) is a specialized type checker built on Golangâ€™s type system that performs precise and efficient validation of SMT-LIB2 logical formulas.

SMTC is part of a larger project, SMTC, that focuses on improving SMT solving using static analysis and _pre-solver_ tools.

## Implementation

SMTC is implemented in Go, leveraging its strong type system and efficient compilation. The implementation focuses on:

- Type-safe validation of SMT-LIB2 (v2.6) expressions
- Efficient memory management using Go's garbage collection
- Modular design with separate theory implementations
- Performance optimization through concurrent validation

The core architecture consists of:

- A lexer/parser for SMT-LIB2 syntax
- Type inference and checking system
- Theory-specific validators
- Logic combinators
- Detailed error reporting and diagnostic suggestions

### [SMT-LIB as a Type Definition Language: A Self-Extensible Type Checking Framework](#)

**Abstract:**

SMT solvers serve as essential tools for analyzing constraints in practical applications such as program synthesis and symbolic execution. Proper SMT validation through type checking helps ensure the correctness and reliability of these analysis tools. Existing approaches typically embed type validation rules within specific solvers or tools, which requires nontrivial development efforts. We present a novel framework that leverages SMT-LIB itself as a type definition language. Our approach reformulates the traditional model of SMT type validation by treating SMT-LIB specifications as type definition files, enabling a flexible and maintainable type validation system. We demonstrate this through SMT Compiler (SMTC), a standalone preprocessor that combines concurrent processing with Go's type system. SMTC validates formulas against the SMT-LIB v2.7 formal grammar specification and supports dynamic type system extension, offering a solver-agnostic solution that enhances both correctness and development workflow. As a result, this would allow SMT solver developers to seamlessly validate new theories and logics while maintaining separation from core solving operations. [[read more...]](#)
